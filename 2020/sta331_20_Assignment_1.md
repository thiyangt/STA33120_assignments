## Task

Write an R function to compute n-step transition probability matrix.

Hint:

- Decide suitable inputs.

- Main function calculation.

- Brainstorm what use cases would be possible to answer.

Here are just a few examples of possible use cases: 

    - Negatives values or values greater than 1 for probabilities.

    - The row sums of the transition probabilities do not equal to 1.

- Output: results, warnings/ messages (if applicable)

- Include test example(s)

## Documents to submit

- function in .R file (ASXXXXXXX.R)


## Method of Evaluation

- Accuracy

- Computational time 


## End goal

Create an R package for stochastic processes calculations.
